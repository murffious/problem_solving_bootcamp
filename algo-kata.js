GOALS: time and space(memory) complexity lowest possible while considering readability/code quality/clean for maintanence and technical debt 

1. compare two items/variables usually not always in a loop
if(aVar === bVar){

}
2. divide and conquer 
pick an index and then check that half and keep splitting until found 


Doing coding problems is just following certain tactics kinda like karate or kata - - muscle memory kicks in and then you develop "intuition"

Seeing how others solved something and learning patterns even math patterns of ways of solving stuff - 

dynamic programming
